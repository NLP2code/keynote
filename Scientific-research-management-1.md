# How to improve Scientific and Engineering Research management capability in company


Improving scientific and engineering research management capability within a company is a complex but crucial endeavor for driving innovation and maintaining a competitive edge. It requires a holistic approach that addresses **strategy, process, people, and culture**. 

---

Here's a breakdown of key strategies and best practices:

# 1. **Goal and Value** - Strategic Alignment and Portfolio Management
**Align R&D with Business Goals:** Ensure that all research and development projects are clearly linked to the company's overall business strategy. This means defining a clear vision for the R&D department and ensuring that its **objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)**.

---

**Implement Portfolio Management:** Don't view R&D as a collection of individual projects. Instead, manage it as a portfolio of initiatives that balances different types of projects. This can include:

- **Balanced Portfolio:** A mix of basic research, new product development, and incremental improvements to existing products.

- **Technology-Leader Innovation:** High-risk, high-reward projects in emerging technologies to gain a competitive advantage.

- **Market-Driven Strategy:** Projects based on industry trends and customer demands to ensure product relevance.

- **Use Phase-Gate Processes:** Implement a structured process with "phase gates" or **decision points** at key stages of a project's life cycle. This allows management to **evaluate progress, reallocate resources, or even terminate projects** that are no longer viable, preventing the waste of time and money.

---

# 2. **Scope, Asset and Uncertainty** - Process and Project Management
- Establish Clear **Project Objectives and Scope:** Define the **purpose, outcomes, and boundaries of each project** from the start. This prevents "scope creep/shift" and ensures everyone is working towards a common goal.

- Adopt **Agile Methodologies:** While not suitable for all R&D, agile methodologies like **Scrum or Kanban** can be highly effective in fostering transparency, accountability, and adaptability in fast-paced research environments.

- **Efficient Resource Management:** Wisely allocate personnel, equipment, and funding across multiple projects. This involves having a clear understanding of the **resources available and prioritizing high-value initiatives**.

--- 
- **Risk and Uncertainty Management:** R&D is inherently uncertain. Develop strong risk management strategies to identify potential setbacks and have plans in place to mitigate them.

- **Knowledge Management:** Implement systems for documenting all project knowledge, research data, and findings. This is essential for building on previous work, avoiding redundancies, and ensuring the company's intellectual property is protected.

---
# 3. **People and Culture** - Innovative and Learning

Build the Right Team: Create a **dedicated R&D team** with a diverse **mix of expertise and skills**. Recruit individuals who not only have the necessary technical qualifications but also fit well with the **team's culture of innovation and collaboration**.

**Foster an Innovative Culture**: Promote a psychologically safe environment where **team members feel comfortable suggesting new ideas and taking risks without fear of failure**. Encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.

**Employee-Centric Leadership**: Be an empathetic and self-aware leader who focuses on employee well-being and professional development. Create individual development plans (IDPs) to help team members achieve their career goals.

---

**Encourage Continuous Learning**: Provide opportunities for training, workshops (internal/university cooperators), conferences (external/industry), and advanced education. An R&D team's expertise is its greatest asset, and continuous learning **keeps it sharp** and up-to-date.

**Recognize and Reward**: Acknowledge and celebrate successes to boost morale and motivate the team. This can be through formal recognition programs or simply by celebrating small wins.

---
# 4. Collaboration and Communication
- Improve Communication Channels: Establish reliable and transparent communication channels, such as **weekly updates and regular meetings with stakeholders**. Ensure that all team members are **kept informed of project progress and any changes in direction**.

- **Leverage External Partnerships**: Don't limit your R&D to internal resources. **Strategic partnerships with other organizations, research centers, or universities can provide access to supplementary expertise and a fresh perspective.**

- **Involve Customers**: Involve customers in the R&D process, especially during the requirements gathering and product testing phases. Their feedback is invaluable for developing products that **meet real-world needs** and for identifying areas for improvement.

---
- Cross-Functional Collaboration: **Break down silos between R&D and other departments like marketing, sales, and manufacturing**. This ensures that the innovations developed are not only technically sound but also commercially viable and can be successfully brought to market.
